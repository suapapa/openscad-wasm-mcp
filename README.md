# openscad-wasm-mcp

An OpenSCAD Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that runs OpenSCAD in Node.js/TypeScript using WebAssembly (`openscad-wasm`). No native OpenSCAD installation on the host is required.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run with Docker Compose

By default, the server runs in Docker with restricted privileges:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The MCP server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3333/mcp`.

### 2. Configure MCP Client

Add the server to your MCP client configuration (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`):

**Using HTTP Transport (default):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openscad-wasm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/client-cli", "http://127.0.0.1:3333/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

### OpenSCAD Tools
- `openscad_validate`: Validates SCAD code and returns syntax/logical diagnostics.
- `openscad_export_model`: Exports model to `stl`, `3mf`, `off`, `csg`, `dxf`, or `svg`.
- `openscad_render_preview`: Generates a server-side WebP render or an interactive 3D preview link.
- `openscad_create_preview_link`: Generates a URL to open a browser-based interactive 3D viewer.
- `openscad_analyze_model`: Computes the model's bounding box and triangle count.

### Workspace Tools
- `workspace_list_files`: Lists files in the container workspace.
- `workspace_read_file`: Reads a file from the workspace.
- `workspace_write_file`: Writes a file to the workspace.
- `workspace_delete_file`: Deletes a file from the workspace.

## Artifacts

Renders and model exports are saved under `./workspace/artifacts` on the host. The MCP tool responses return metadata: `path`, `filename`, `format`, `mimeType`, `sizeBytes`, and `sha256`.

## Configuration

Customize runtime limits (memory, timeouts, directories) by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and editing the environment variables.

## Known Limitations

- **Performance**: Complex models can be slow or memory-intensive inside WebAssembly.
- **Visuals**: WebP previews do not preserve OpenSCAD colors, GUI helpers, or 2D camera perspectives.
- **Assets & Libraries**: Fonts and external libraries are not bundled; you must upload necessary files to the workspace first.
- **Format Support**: Build-specific limits may affect exports (e.g., `3mf` is currently unsupported).
